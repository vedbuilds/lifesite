I love you baby
I will adore you forever
You would have loved me too
If I was him, Maybe

I wanna talk with you under the starry sky
With your hand in my palm
I am just a quixotic guy
Who watches romcoms

I chose to love you in a
Unrequited Unconditional way
Cause you are a ray of a sunshine
That's what I say

Maybe if I was him
I could have got all the things I have dreamed of
But I am not him
Yet I am not gonna back off

I am not him
I wont say I am better than him
This is me
A dedicated guy who is drowning 
Drowning in the sea of love he has for you

Can't you see
I have fallen deep inside
Inside the depths of your soul
Inside the depths of you eyes

I love you baby
I will always do
I will make you fall for me
Maybe?

Loving you is an adventure,
Everyday is a rollercoaster,
A rollercoaster filled with emotion, 
Full of devotion

For me you are my god
You are my angel
U are like the guitar's chord
Which brings light to the record

But you know what 
Fuck the thing called fate
It has put me in such a state
Where all i can do is just wait

I know that you can't be mine
Knowing this fact
I still act
That i ain't cryin

You are a smile that i never own
And a love that i feel yet stay unknown 
You are the color of life
But the truth cuts me like a knife

But i face all this shit
With one little fake hope that i won't quit
That u might be mine
At least while I am dyin

I'll cherish even one second 
And it will be playing in my 7 minutes 

Loving you is an adventure 
So as a normal gesture 
When some one asks me Ça va?
I reply "Je na sais pas"

Your sun-kissed eyes
look like hessonite
they are the light
Of my life

Your delicate smile
makes me fall
your intricate hairstyle
The best of all

I swear you are an angel
Whom i stumbled upon
In this shitty world
Ur are the one of the people who i wish to hold on

When i saw you
my heart skipped a beat
thats when i knew
we were destined to meet

I stare at you 
when you are not watching
cuz thats when u are being u 
and thats eye-catching

I can write a lot more
but thats all for now
you are the one i adore
see you later CIAO

if ur the sky, let me be the stars 

if ur elon, i am mars

My heart skips a beat 
Whenever i see you
No matter what time it is
I am always thinking of you

I look in to 
ur heavenly brown eyes
I could write abt them
but words wont suffice

You are like whiskey in a teacup
Delicate and fragile
Yet strong and fierce
and is always cheered up

Your smile so wide
And your laugh soo hearty
I won't lie
It makes my heart party

U are angelic
mysterious and divine
But i know the truth
That u cant be mine


But just remember i love you
and will always do
When you'll need me
I'll be there waiting for you
